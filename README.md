<h1>Rap Album Review Angular Demo</h1>

This toy app is based on the angular seed app.  There is no backend hooked-up.  Strictly front-end.

Built this to get a better understanding of Angular's two-way binding, MVC, and directives.  You can use the form to add album from Amazon using the ASIN number to pull the images while adding in the rest of the info manually.  Very barebones app.  Looking to build on it by adding a backend (Rails or Node.js?), add more styling, and authentication.
